I wanted to better contextualize on and improve a graph of instances of suicide in Alleghney County from 2008-2017. The graph I used with data included is on page 6 of the following document: https://www.alleghenycountyanalytics.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/19-ACDHS-06-Suicide-Brief_v3.pdf

<iframe title="Number of suicides by year and age group, 2008-2017" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-aR0sO" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aR0sO/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="700"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

The two age groups that have experienced the largest increases in rates of suicide from 2008 to 2017 are Allegheny County residents age 25-34 and 65-74. In order to reduce the suicide rate for these two at-risk age groups, programming should be financed specifically to reach these Allegheny County residents.

<iframe title="Percent change of suicides by age group, 2008-2017" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-aR0sO" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aR0sO/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="410"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

For almost all groups, the percentage of suicides has increased dramatically from 2008 to 2017, with the exception of those 85 years and older. People aged 65-74 in Allegheny County seem to be specifically at risk of suicide based on these results. 

<iframe title="Total number of suicides by age group, 2008-2017" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-FrtkF" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FrtkF/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>

The number of total suicides between 2008-2017 is highest for Allegheny County residents aged 45-54 with 343 reported suicides. While their suicide rate hasn't increased the most over this ten-year period, the absolute number of suicides demonstrates that programming should be targeted at this age range to ensure that the number of suicides will decrease as we enter the third decade of the 21st century.

#Wireframing

My wireframes started out relatively similar to the final product but with a few key changes. I knew that I wanted to simplify the coloring of the first graph, and I think my wireframe and my final product achieved that. My plan for the second viz was to show the percentage change in suicides using the 2008 data and the 2017 data. What I found in doing that was a huge change in the 65-74 year old group. When I presented this wireframe to a classmate, they said that the 500% change was huge and made all the other numbers look so small that they were impossible to distinguish (a lot like the problem we saw in the Jeremy Corbyn example). They also couldn't believe that those data were true. I thought it may be a little more honest and easy to process if I smoothed the data a bit by taking an average of the first two years and last two years, and then calculating that percentage change. That way, an outlier year wouldn't misrepresent the data as much as it did in the first wireframe. Calculating the change in this way also allowed me to reduce the axes, making the information more visually easy to process without delegitimizing it. If anything, I think the data are more legitimate this way. A classmate pointed out to me in my third viz that the age ranges made it seem like some groups had far more suicides based on the fact that there are just more people in those age ranges (10-14 vs. 25-34, for instance). In order to stay away from this problem, I changed the age ranges to be in groups of 10 years for all ages reported. (In order for this to work, I had to take away the 10-14 age group, which because of the extremely low number is hard to process anyway.) I wanted to highlight in the second and third viz the largest and potentially smallest numbers to help make that information more salient to a reader. In my wireframes, I didn't do this, and my readers spent more time analyzing than I thought they would have to. One change I made between the two wireframes and the final draft is changing the format of the second viz to be horizontal bars instead of vertical. I think the change helps demonstrate the negative percentage value better than in the vertical form. I also arranged it largest to smallest. I think it makes the ages a little harder to distinguish but helps the reader view the bars first and then figure out the attached age ranges second. I'm really eager for feedback, so please let me know what you think I can improve!
